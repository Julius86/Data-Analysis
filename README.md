# ABOUT ME 

### DISCLAIMER: 

### This repository was created with the objective of my personal education and I will attempt to update it with web scrapping, data analysts and basic machine learning code and projects. 
### I am not yet a professional Data Analyst and I do not claim to be one. Many of the attempts I try with this exercise may or may not result in correct predictions of data and must be taking with a big grain of salt.

I am an aspiring Data Analyst and this github repository will be updated with the intention of providing evidence to my work and projects, as well as my development as a data analyst.
