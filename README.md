# ABOUT ME 

### DISCLAIMER: 

### This site was created with the objective of education, I will attempt to find out who is the player that most deserves the MVP by a pure statistical standpoint scrapping the information from the official NFL Stats website: https://www.nfl.com/stats/player-stats/
### I am not yet a professional Data Analyst and do not claim to be one. Many of the attempts I try with this exercise may or may not result in correct predictions of data and must be taking with a big grain of salt.

I am an aspiring Data Analyst and this github repository will be updated with the intention of providing evidence to my work and projects, as well as my development as a data analyst.
